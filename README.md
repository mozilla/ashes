# Ashes

Ashes is a debug server which collects logs (and more, soon). It enables fast
debugging of issues and helps to ease the burden of log collection for QA.

## Access Ashes

1. Visit the secure site:
   https://ashes.paas.allizom.org/
2. Sign in with your Mozilla email (it must be `@mozilla.com` to work)
3. Enter the ID of a log to view the log data

## Submitting logs

1. Visit the debug console using one of two ways:
 1. **For pages with a search box:** Search for `:debug`. (This method won't work if you're on a site with no search box)
 2. **For other pages:** Press and hold on the Marketplace logo in the upper left.
2. Press the blue button labeled "Submit logs".
3. You'll see an ID number in a notification. Copy it down and post it in your bug.
